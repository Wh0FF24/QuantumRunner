##Quantum Runner
#Overview
Quantum Runner is an endless 2D mobile game where players navigate through a procedurally generated landscape, using unique mechanics like time manipulation, light control, and quantum shifting to avoid obstacles and survive as long as possible. The game features simple touch controls and progressively challenging gameplay.

#Game Concept
Players control a character that runs automatically through an endless, procedurally generated world. The objective is to survive as long as possible by jumping over obstacles, using time manipulation to slow down, emitting light to reveal hidden paths, and shifting between parallel dimensions to navigate around hazards.

#Core Mechanics
Running and Jumping
Running: The character runs automatically.
Jumping: Tap the screen to make the character jump over obstacles.
Time Manipulation
Slow Down Time: Swipe up to temporarily slow down time, making it easier to navigate through fast-moving obstacles. This ability has a cooldown period.
Light Control
Emit Light: Swipe down to emit a beam of light that reveals hidden platforms and deactivates certain traps. The light beam can also interact with environmental elements to create safe paths.
Quantum Mechanics
Shift Dimensions: Swipe left or right to shift between parallel dimensions, each with different layouts and challenges. Certain obstacles may only exist in one dimension, and players must switch dimensions to avoid them.
Game Features

#Endless Gameplay
The game world is procedurally generated, ensuring unique runs every time.
The difficulty increases gradually with more complex obstacles and a faster pace.
Power-Ups and Upgrades
Power-Ups: Collect power-ups to enhance abilities, such as extended time manipulation, stronger light beams, or longer dimension shifts.
Upgrades: Use in-game currency to upgrade abilities and unlock new character skins.
Visual and Audio Design

#Art Style: Minimalist visuals with clear, contrasting designs to highlight obstacles and paths.
Lighting Effects: Dynamic lighting effects to emphasize light control mechanics.
Soundtrack: An engaging soundtrack that adapts to the pace of the game.

#Obstacles
Static Barriers: Simple obstacles to jump over or navigate around.
Moving Hazards: Obstacles that move in patterns, requiring precise timing or time manipulation to avoid.
Hidden Platforms: Platforms visible only when illuminated by the playerâ€™s light beam.
Dimensional Barriers: Obstacles existing in one dimension but not the other, requiring dimension shifts to pass.

#Monetization and Replayability
Advertisements: Optional ads for reviving after a failed run or earning additional in-game currency.
In-App Purchases: Cosmetic items like character skins and themes, and power-up bundles.
Leaderboards and Achievements: Global leaderboards for high scores and achievements for reaching milestones and completing challenges.

#Controls
Tap: Jump
Swipe Up: Slow down time
Swipe Down: Emit light
Swipe Left/Right: Shift dimensions

#Development Plan
Core Mechanics: Develop running, jumping, and basic obstacle avoidance first. Implement time manipulation, light control, and quantum shifting mechanics next.
Procedural Generation: Create a system for generating endless, varied levels. Ensure the difficulty scales smoothly over time.
Polishing and Testing: Test gameplay extensively to balance difficulty and ensure smooth controls. Polish visuals and audio for a cohesive and engaging player experience.
